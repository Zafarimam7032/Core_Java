  <h1>this is first blog</h1>
  <h3>this is my first blog post</h3>
  <p> 
    Some of the reasons is because the blog editor is trying to prevent un-schematic html markups inside a  tag which normally users do when copying & pasting texts directly to the post editor  without removing formatting.It becomes worse when modern web browsers reactsdisplays differently when  tags is not schematic with added markups.In addition, blogger post editor is not "smart" enough to "repair" users doings - unlike other platforms with modern editor Ui. If you feel that users really needs this, then you sned your feedback directly to the Team at the orange Send Feedback button at your dashboard.I hope you'd understand the current conditions.
